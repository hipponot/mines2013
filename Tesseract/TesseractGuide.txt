#HERE'S ALL YOU SHOULD HAVE TO DO:
	sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

#Then navigate to the Tesseract folder and run some tesseract commands; for example: 

>tesseract -psm 10 1.jpg out
>cat out.txt


#You should see a 1; if you do, GREAT
#If you want better output, Grant has included a config file that will let you restrict Tesseract's readings to digits; to do a command using that, use:

>tesseract -psm 10 1.jpg out nobatch digits

#If you did not get a desired result, go below, because you may have to compile your own Tesseract with leptonica

---------------------------------------------

#IF THAT DOES NOT WORK, HERE IS THE PROCESS FOR INSTALLING EVERYTHING

#Leptonica should be installed and working fine, but if not, these steps will help you toward compiling your own Tesseract

#Tesseract command line compilation guide (for Vagrant box):

#(Borrowed primarily from 
# https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/Compiling )

#/****Process*****\

#Install some libraries (if needed):
	sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev
	sudo apt-get install libtiff4-dev

#Navigate to tesseract folder (if you're trying to start fresh, you may want to empty it first) and install leptonica:
	gunzip leptonica-1.69.tar.gz
	tar -xvf leptonica-1.69.tar
	cd leptonica-1.69
	./configure
	make
	make install
	sudo ldconfig

#To install Tesseract in $HOME/local:
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/
	make install

#Download language data:
	wget http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/files/tesseract-ocr-3.01.eng.tar.gz
	tar xf tesseract-ocr-3.01.eng.tar.gz
	export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/vagrant/Tesseract/tesseract-ocr/

#If needed, install tesseract (if tesseract commands fail):
	sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

#
